In this repo, you will find the source and header files for a small project I worked on in order to learn Qt. 

A color picker which can pick any color on screen is something I've been wanting to make for a while, so here it is.

The ColorPicker was created using a Qt project template as its base in Visual Studio 2015. It was my first time using Qt, but I enjoyed it! I think this may be my new goto GUI framework for any personal projects written in C++.
